NOTES-

repl.it ~ > a website where one can work over any platform , and over any programming language
Virtual Box reads resource information from OS
Virtual Box creates a new Hardware from the resources available free in your system
time required to create an OS using docker is 1.2 sec(maximum)

PAS - > Platform as a Service

every 3 years a new Redhat OS is launched
Backend project of redhat is Fedora that is fedora is developed for 3 years which after completion is produced with name Redhat
Fedora is more powerful then Redhat
in a terminal , by default bash is always running
Spotify is based on docker- a containerised application
open blog - > slashdevops and search for docker
if a command is run in /etc/profile it will run always when a user is logged in

LINUX Commands -

$ tac file-name.txt # reverse the order of reading from bottom to top
$ rev file-name.txt # reverse the words in file reading from top to bottom
$ qrencode -s 16x16 -o file-name.png web-site-link # Creates a QR code for the websites, -o shows output to save
$ systemctl enable docker # start the docker each time OS
$ systemctl start docker # initiate docker
$ docker ps # shows running iso file
$ docker ps -a # shows all containers running or shut-down
$ docker ps -qa # shows all id's of all pre-made containers
$ docker rm $(docker ps -qa) # delete all the containers
$ docker tag old-iso-name new-iso-name # make a copy of old-iso image with a new name with same id
$ docker rmi docker-image-tag # removes the docker image with tag provided
$ docker inspect elated_yonath # gives details about docker from which we can get ip

Docker-

Provides Environment for different OS and technologies
Docker uses kernel of base OS to develop more OS images for the use.
           [ Docker]
         [   RHEL    ]    
        [   Hardware  ]
it runs an OS for some dedicated purpose like running only Python that is running an micro Service
Docker is like a ship with containers of OS
the base OS doesn't know or have no information about the OS installed in containers.
Each container has its own IP, MAC to connect with outside world.
It is a technology provider
it works on GO language
search OS iso in hub.docker.com or run Command
$ docker search technology-name
to install image from docker use
$ docker pull image-name
to check installed images
$ docker images
to run a docker image
$ docker run -it fedora
# it stand for interactive terminal
to change docker name , run command
$ docker run -it --name some-name docker-image-name process-to-run
to check for shutdown container run Command
$ docker ps -a
to restart a shut down container , run Command
$ docker attach container-name
to restart a docker image and exit without closing the container, run Command
  $ docker exec -it docker-container-name process-name

Working-

in backend , it talks to the kernel of based OS and creates a new container with OS of given image which contains all those micro services that you need to work with

after work completion , the container shutdowns itself

Docker is an application oriented system - > as soon as the application for which container was created is closed the container also shutdowns itself

Single process oriented system - > no more then one process can run on this container

RUN - > create a new container from docker images

login to Browser instead of putty
install shell in a box software
search shellinaboc centos 7
copy binary package link location
root login
$ rpm -ivh paste link
$ systemctl start shellinaboxd
$ systemctl enable shellinaboxd
$ setenforce 0
$ nano /etc/selinux/config
change enforcing to disabled
in inbound allow a port 4200 to anywhere which is a port of shellinabox
shellinabox is a socket which uses TCP protocol
change ec2-user password
in browser open url
 https://public:4200
