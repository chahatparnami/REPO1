Notes  :

systemctl is a command not supported in docker-containers
all the processes are present in systemd command which is the parent process for all
To run different containers directly through public ip , provide each conatiner with different port no so that each user can be fowarded based on combination ip and port to respected containers
.png format is not supported in ubuntu, it supports .svg
Network Web injection

Linux Commands-

$ kill -s STOP 'pidof firefox' # used to send a process of firefoox in pause state
$ kill -s CONT 'pidof firefox' # it will resume the state of firefoox
$ docker run -itd docker-image process -name # d - > dettach, run the container but user doesn't login to container instead container moves to background
$ docker stop container-id # to stop a running containers

Create a Docker Image-

to do so we use Docker File
change a pre-existing image and save it with new name
create a empty directory
place evrything you wish in your new image in that directory
Create a file with name Dockerfile
FROM - > checks for file in local system and if not present pull from DOCKER HUB

RUN - > run a specific command you wish to run after entering the container

COPY - > copy the files present in the directory to the image of docker being created

EXPOSE - > Port no to activate in docker image being created

ENTRYPOINT - > Which process to initiate by default for any new Image, it can not be replaced

CMD - >Which process to initiate by default for any new Image, it can be replaced
run command to create docker Image
$ docker build -t "image-name" directory-name

launch a container with port forwarding , run Command
$ docker run -itd --name docker-container-name -p xxxx:80 docker-image-name

-p stands for Port and xxxx is port no added to inbound in security
